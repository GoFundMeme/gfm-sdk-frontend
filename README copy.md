# 🚀 Fair Launch Raises  

The **Fair Launch** mechanism in the **GoFundMeme Protocol** enables decentralized, transparent, and community-driven token launches. This system ensures equitable access to presale allocations while dynamically adjusting fundraising based on demand.  

With the **GoFundMeme SDK**, you can seamlessly:  
✅ Fetch Fair Launch pool details  
✅ Fund or defund a pool  
✅ Claim presale allocations  
✅ Claim preallocations (marketing, team, etc.)  
✅ Harvest LP fees and rewards  

## 🛠️ Fetching a Fair Launch Pool  

To interact with a **Fair Launch pool**, you must first fetch its data using the **mint address** of the token being launched.  

```ts
import { Connection, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { initGoFundMemeSDK } from "@gofundmeme/sdk";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");

(async () => {
  const gfmSDK = await initGoFundMemeSDK({ connection });

  // Replace with your token mint address
  const mintAddress = new PublicKey("THE TOKEN MINT ADDRESS");

  // Fetch the Fair Launch Pool
  const pool = await gfmSDK.pools.fairLaunch.fetchFairLaunchPool({
    mintB: mintAddress,
  });

  console.log("Fair Launch Pool Data:", pool);
})();
```

---

## 📊 Checking Pool Status  

Once you've fetched the **Fair Launch pool**, you can check its **status, expiration, and funding progress**.  

```ts
import moment from "moment";

const { poolStatus, expirationTimestamp, targetRaise, totalRaised } =
  pool.poolData;

if (poolStatus.raising) {
  console.log("✅ The pool is still in the raising phase.");
}

if (moment(expirationTimestamp.toNumber() * 1000).isAfter(moment())) {
  console.log("⏳ The pool has not expired yet!");
}

if (targetRaise.toNumber() > totalRaised.toNumber()) {
  const remainingSolToRaise =
    (targetRaise.toNumber() - totalRaised.toNumber()) / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL;
  console.log("⚠️ Pool is NOT fully funded yet!", { remainingSolToRaise });
}
```

---

## 💰 Funding the Pool  

Participants can contribute **SOL** to the **Fair Launch pool** before it reaches its target.  

```ts
import { Keypair, sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "@solana/web3.js";

const payer = Keypair.generate(); // Replace with your actual signer

// Create a funding transaction (1 SOL in this example)
const fundTransaction = await pool.actions.fund({
  solAmount: 1,
  funder: payer.publicKey,
});

// Sign and send the transaction
const fundTxid = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, fundTransaction, [
  payer,
]);

console.log(`🎉 Successfully funded the pool! TXID: ${fundTxid}`);
```

---

## 💸 Defunding (Withdrawing Contributions)  

If the pool is **still in the raising phase**, participants can withdraw their contributions.  

```ts
const defundTransaction = await pool.actions.defund({
  funder: payer.publicKey,
});

const defundTxid = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  defundTransaction,
  [payer]
);

console.log(`💸 Successfully defunded the pool! TXID: ${defundTxid}`);
```

---

## 🎟️ Claiming Presale Allocations  

After the **Fair Launch concludes**, contributors can claim their **presale tokens**.  

```ts
const claimPresaleTransaction = await pool.actions.claimPresale({
  funder: payer.publicKey,
});

const claimPresaleTxid = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  claimPresaleTransaction,
  [payer]
);

console.log(`🎟️ Presale tokens claimed! TXID: ${claimPresaleTxid}`);
```

---

## 🎯 Claiming Preallocation (Marketing, Team, etc.)  

Some tokens are reserved for marketing, partnerships, or team allocations. These can be claimed separately.  

```ts
const claimPreallocationTransaction = await pool.actions.claimPreallocation({
  funder: payer.publicKey,
});

const claimPreallocationTxid = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  claimPreallocationTransaction,
  [payer]
);

console.log(`🚀 Preallocation tokens claimed! TXID: ${claimPreallocationTxid}`);
```

---

## 🏦 Fetching LP Fees & Harvester Rewards  

Once the **Fair Launch concludes**, LP fees and harvester rewards can be tracked.  

```ts
const summary = await pool.actions.harvestUtils.getLpStateSummary();
console.log("📊 LP Fee Summary:", summary);
```

### 📌 Example Response:  

```json
{
  "totalHarvested": {
    "tokenA": 33.013248883,

## 🌾 Harvesting LP Fees  

LP fees collected in the pool can be **harvested** by authorized crankers.  

```ts
const harvestTransaction = await pool.actions.harvestUtils.harvest({
  cranker: payer.publicKey,
});

const harvestTxid = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  harvestTransaction,
  [payer]
);

console.log(`🌾 LP fees successfully harvested! TXID: ${harvestTxid}`);
```

---

## 🎁 Fetching Presaler Rewards Summary  

Presale contributors can **check their unclaimed LP rewards** before claiming.  

```ts
const presalerRewardsSummary =
  await pool.actions.funderRewardsUtils.fetchFunderRewardsSummary({
    funder: payer.publicKey,
  });

console.log("🎁 Presaler Rewards Summary:", presalerRewardsSummary);
```

Once rewards are available, contributors can claim them.  

```ts
const claimPresalerRewardsTransaction =
  await pool.actions.funderRewardsUtils.claimRewards({
    funder: payer.publicKey,
  });

const claimPresalerRewardsTxid = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  claimPresalerRewardsTransaction,
  [payer]
);

# 💎 Bonding Curve Pools  

The **Bonding Curve Pool** is a dynamic pricing mechanism used in the **GoFundMeme Protocol** to enable seamless token swaps. Instead of relying on traditional order books, **bonding curves** establish an automated market maker (AMM)-style system where price adjusts based on supply and demand.  

With the **GoFundMeme SDK**, you can:  
✅ Fetch **Bonding Curve pool** details  
✅ Buy tokens from the bonding curve  
✅ Sell tokens back for SOL  
✅ Harvest LP fees and staking rewards  
✅ Stake, unstake, and claim rewards  

---

## 🛠️ Fetching a Bonding Curve Pool  

To interact with a **Bonding Curve Pool**, fetch its data using the **mint address** of the token launched in a Fair Launch.  

```ts
import { Connection, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { initGoFundMemeSDK } from "@gofundmeme/sdk";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");

(async () => {
  const gfmSDK = await initGoFundMemeSDK({ connection });

  // Replace with the token mint address
  const mintAddress = new PublicKey("THE TOKEN MINT ADDRESS");

  // Fetch the Bonding Curve Pool
  const bondingCurvePool = await gfmSDK.pools.bondingCurve.fetchBondingCurvePool(
    { mintB: mintAddress }
  );

  console.log("Bonding Curve Pool Data:", bondingCurvePool);
})();
```

---

## 📊 Checking Pool Status

```ts
import { LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } from "@solana/web3.js";

const { poolStatus, targetRaise, totalRaised } = bondingCurvePool.poolData;

if (poolStatus.raising) {
  console.log("✅ The pool is still in the raising phase.");
}

if (targetRaise.toNumber() > totalRaised.toNumber()) {
  const remainingSolToRaise =
    (targetRaise.toNumber() - totalRaised.toNumber()) / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL;
  console.log("⚠️ Pool is NOT fully funded yet!", { remainingSolToRaise });
}
```

---

## 🛒 Buying Tokens on the Bonding Curve
